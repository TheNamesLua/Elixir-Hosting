# Elixir-Hosting
Free Easy Port forwarding Minecraft Servers.


### ELIXIR IS NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED YET! ###

Essentially what Elixir does is allows you to create your own Minecraft server by simply running an exe. It handles all package downloads and port forwarding allowing users to connect to your server anywhere. It allows you to expose a local web server to the internet (in this case 25565).
